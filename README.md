# Interview

## Target audience
1. Government officials who are in charge of food & nutrition assistance. For example, officials in the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
2. Individuals who are concerned of food inequality issue in his or her community and eager to offer help.

## Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
It is difficult to find government officials in charge of food & nutrition assistance to interview. However, I have found two classmates who have worked for U.S Food & Drug Departments before. The other interviewee is also a classmate who grow up in Pittsburgh. He knows much information about the situation of food insecurity in Pittsburgh and his family makes regular donation to the community. 

## Interview Script
Interviewee 1:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
It is like a brochure calling people to help Black communities who are suffering food insecurity. 

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Food insecurity issue has been disproportionately affecting Black communities and the situation is even worse during the pandemic.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Not really, its pretty clear.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Basically everyone could be your audience. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Too many words. People may be unwilling to read all those stuff.

Interviewee 2:

It emphasizes why food insecurity disproportionately affect Blacks and it proposes some suggestions.

It will be difficult to solve racial inequity in food but immediate action is needed.

No, it is logic.

Government?

You can add some explanations in donation part and cut some words in analysis part.

Interviewee 3:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A proposal for saving Black people from food insecurity.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Everyone can make efforts to solve food insecurity issue among black communities.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
It makes sense. Nothing confuses me.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
You have made it clear in recommendation section that government and common people are targets.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
You might want to add more links directing audience to some useful websites.

## Findings from the interview
Interviwees are generally satisfy with the logic of the story but they pointed out that audience may be tired of too many word. Besides, I could provide useful links to them.

## Plan of Changes
cut some paragraphs and add some simple titles instead. Find some useful links for recommendation part.
